Starting the autumn season with “all.cake.all.night” project by Teresa Stillebacher and the Aesthetic Athletics+ collective! The team built a spatial architectural pavilion in the Artistic Courtyard of the HART hostel, where they invites residents of Nadodrze (and beyond!) to participate in a spatial intervention in the form of an open kitchen, cooking together, art meetings and conversations at one large table.
The project began in September, when the Austrian architect started her residency in Wrocław under the European MagiC Carpets platform. Teresa Stillebacher came to Wrocław with her architect friends and lecturers from the Austrian collective Aesthetic Athletics+. The group, together with the help of a local creator, Tytus Presiński (zresztek.pl), constructed a spacious Pavilion equipped with a field kitchen and DIY furniture. The facility, which was built in the yard at 25a Rydygiera Street is made entirely of second-cycle materials.

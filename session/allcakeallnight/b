Pavilion official opening happened last month – now it’s time for the second stage of the project filled with culinary and artistic activities in one of the most creative energazied backyards of Nadodrze!

We invite residents of Nadodrze (and beyond) to participate in a spatial intervention in the form of an open kitchen, cooking together, neighborly dinners, conversations at one large table and the grand finale – an exhibition summarizing the cooperation of artists with the local community.
